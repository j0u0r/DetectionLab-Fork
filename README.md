# Adapt Imitate cloner (WIP)
> - Adapt Imitate is part of ADAPT(Active Directory Automation PlaTform), a Final Year Project that me and my group is working on. This project focuses on automated processes, so everything will be automated and won't be so troublesome for users.
> - ADAPT has 2 parts, Imitate and Assault. Imitate is to enumerate an AD environment, then make a new virtual AD environment using the obtained information, sort of like replication. Assault then pentests the 'cloned' AD environment.
> - For this project, i have been tasked to create the 'cloning' part of Adapt Imitate. You can find everything i've done in the links below!  
- I have annotated Detectionlab, which is built using Vagrant, to learn and familiarise myself with Vagrant.
  - Link to forked repository: https://github.com/j0u0r/DetectionLab-Fork
- I have created an AD environment using Vagrant that will be used as the victim. Instructions, more information and troubleshooting is provided in the repository.
  - Link to repository: https://github.com/j0u0r/vagrant-victim  
- I have created a program that uses Vagrant to clone an AD environment via information provided in a csv file. Instructions, more information and troubleshooting is provided in the repository.
